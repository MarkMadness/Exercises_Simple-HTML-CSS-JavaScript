# Dungeons & Dragons App for building your character's stats

As a fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have custom games I run for my friends and sometimes I have custom rules for the game. For fun and to help out new players to my games, I came up with this handy app for selecting stats for player characters. It has an interface of clickable buttons to increase or decrease your character's score and set parameters in place to limit the user's scoring based on the design of the rule.

Each player has 20 points available for their character's stats and are limited to a score range of 5(minimum) to 11(maximum). They cannot go below or above that range. If the user tries to go below a score of 5 or above a score of 11 for a single stat they will receive a message informing them that they cannot go above or below the range. If the user tries to spend more points than 20, they will also receive a message saying they are limited to a maximum of 20 points to spend.
